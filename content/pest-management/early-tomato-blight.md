# Early Tomato Blight

Early blight is one of the most common diseases affecting tomatoes in community gardens. It's caused by the fungus *Alternaria solani* and can significantly reduce yield if not managed properly.

## Identification

Early blight typically appears as:
- **Dark brown spots** with concentric rings on older, lower leaves
- **Yellowing** of leaves around the spots
- **Stem lesions** that are dark and sunken
- **Fruit rot** with dark, leathery spots near the stem end

The disease usually starts on the lower leaves and progresses upward through the plant.

## Prevention

### Cultural Practices
- **Crop rotation**: Avoid planting tomatoes in the same location for 3-4 years
- **Proper spacing**: Ensure good air circulation between plants
- **Mulching**: Apply organic mulch to prevent soil splash onto leaves
- **Watering**: Water at soil level, avoid wetting the foliage
- **Pruning**: Remove lower branches to improve air circulation

### Resistant Varieties
Choose tomato varieties with resistance to early blight when possible:
- Mountain Fresh Plus
- Iron Lady
- Defiant PhR
- Mountain Magic

## Treatment

### Organic Options
1. **Copper-based fungicides**: Apply preventively before symptoms appear
2. **Baking soda spray**: Mix 1 tsp per quart of water with a few drops of dish soap
3. **Neem oil**: Apply in early morning or evening to avoid leaf burn
4. **Remove affected plant material**: Dispose of in trash, not compost

### Application Schedule
- Begin treatments when plants are established (4-6 weeks after transplanting)
- Apply preventive treatments every 7-14 days during humid conditions
- Always follow label instructions for any fungicide

## Garden Management

### Sanitation
- Remove and destroy infected plant debris at end of season
- Clean tools between plants when working with infected material
- Avoid working in the garden when plants are wet

### Environmental Factors
- Early blight thrives in warm, humid conditions
- Most active when temperatures are 75-85Â°F with high humidity
- Spores spread through wind, rain, and contaminated tools

## When to Seek Help

Contact experienced gardeners or extension services if:
- Disease spreads rapidly despite treatment
- You're unsure about proper identification
- Multiple plants are severely affected
