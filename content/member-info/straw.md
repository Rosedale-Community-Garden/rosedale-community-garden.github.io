# Straw & Mulch

Quality mulch and straw are essential for successful organic gardening. Our garden coordinates bulk purchases and maintains community resources to help members access these materials affordably.

## Why Mulch Matters

### **Benefits of Mulching**
- **Moisture retention**: Reduces watering needs by 30-50%
- **Weed suppression**: Blocks light to prevent weed germination
- **Soil temperature**: Keeps soil cooler in summer, warmer in winter
- **Soil improvement**: Organic mulches break down and add nutrients
- **Erosion prevention**: Protects soil during heavy rains
- **Clean produce**: Keeps vegetables off soil surface

### **Best Practices**
- **Application depth**: 2-4 inches around plants
- **Keep clear**: 2-3 inches away from plant stems
- **Timing**: Apply after soil warms in spring
- **Refresh**: Add new mulch as it decomposes

## Types of Mulch Available

### **Organic Mulches** ‚≠ê *Recommended*

#### **Straw** 
- **Best for**: Vegetable gardens, pathways
- **Pros**: Excellent weed suppression, slow decomposition
- **Application**: 3-4 inches thick
- **Note**: Ensure it's seed-free straw, not hay

#### **Wood Chips**
- **Best for**: Perennial beds, pathways, tree areas
- **Pros**: Long-lasting, good for soil building
- **Application**: 2-3 inches around plants
- **Caution**: Don't till into soil until well-decomposed

### **Inorganic Mulches**

#### **Landscape Fabric**
- **Best for**: Permanent plantings, pathways
- **Pros**: Very effective weed barrier
