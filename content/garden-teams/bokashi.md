# Bokashi Team

The Bokashi Team manages our innovative fermentation-based composting system that allows us to compost all types of kitchen scraps, including meat, dairy, and oils that traditional composting can't handle. We're pioneering sustainable waste reduction through this ancient Japanese technique.

## What is Bokashi?

Bokashi is a Japanese method of composting that uses beneficial microorganisms to ferment organic waste in an anaerobic (oxygen-free) environment. Unlike traditional composting, bokashi can handle:
- **All kitchen scraps**: Including meat, fish, dairy, and oils
- **Cooked foods**: Leftovers and spoiled items
- **Paper products**: Coffee filters, napkins, and paper towels
- **Garden waste**: Leaves, grass clippings, and plant trimmings

## Our Mission

- **Reduce garden waste** by diverting organic matter from landfills
- **Create nutrient-rich soil** through fermentation and composting
- **Educate the community** about bokashi composting methods
- **Provide composting solutions** for all garden members

## How Our System Works

### The Bokashi Process
1. **Collection**: Kitchen scraps collected in airtight bokashi buckets
2. **Layering**: Sprinkle effective microorganisms (EM) between layers
3. **Fermentation**: 2-3 weeks of anaerobic fermentation
4. **Burial**: Fermented waste buried in designated garden areas
5. **Decomposition**: 2-4 weeks for complete breakdown into soil

### Our Infrastructure
- **Community bokashi buckets**: Available for member use
- **Fermentation station**: Covered area for processing buckets
- **Burial sites**: Designated areas throughout the garden
- **EM production**: Making our own effective microorganisms

## What We Do

### System Management
- **Bucket maintenance**: Cleaning and preparing bokashi buckets
- **EM production**: Cultivating beneficial microorganisms
- **Site preparation**: Managing burial and fermentation areas
- **Quality monitoring**: Ensuring proper fermentation conditions

### Education & Training
- **Workshops**: Teaching bokashi methods to new gardeners
- **Demonstrations**: Showing the complete process
- **Troubleshooting**: Helping members solve bokashi problems
- **Resource sharing**: Providing guides and materials

### Research & Development
- **Process improvement**: Testing different techniques and materials
- **Local adaptation**: Adapting bokashi for Colorado conditions
- **Soil testing**: Monitoring soil improvement from bokashi compost
- **Innovation**: Developing new applications for bokashi

## Current Projects

### 2025 Initiatives
- **Expanded bucket program**: Adding 20 more community buckets
- **EM brewing station**: Dedicated area for microorganism production
- **Bokashi accelerator beds**: Fast-track composting areas
- **Measurement program**: Tracking waste diversion and soil improvement

### Ongoing Programs
- **Monthly workshops**: First Wednesday bokashi basics
- **Bucket check-ins**: Weekly maintenance rounds
- **Soil amendment program**: Distributing finished compost
- **Community challenges**: Waste reduction competitions

## Get Involved

### Team Meetings
- **When**: Last Thursday of each month, 6:30 PM
- **Where**: Garden tool shed or community center
- **Contact**: bokashi@rosedalegarden.org

### Volunteer Roles
- **Bucket managers**: Maintain and distribute bokashi buckets
- **EM brewers**: Help produce effective microorganisms
- **Educators**: Teach workshops and assist new users
- **Site coordinators**: Manage burial areas and fermentation sites

### Getting Started
Perfect for gardeners who want to:
- **Reduce household waste** through composting
- **Learn sustainable practices** with immediate impact
- **Improve soil health** in their garden plots
- **Try innovative composting** methods

## Bokashi Benefits

### Environmental Impact
- **Waste reduction**: Diverts 95% of kitchen waste from landfills
- **Methane prevention**: Anaerobic fermentation reduces greenhouse gases
- **Water conservation**: No need for water-intensive composting
- **Soil building**: Creates rich, living soil amendments

### Garden Benefits
- **Fast decomposition**: Fermented waste breaks down in weeks, not months
- **Pest prevention**: Properly fermented bokashi doesn't attract rodents
- **Nutrient density**: High concentration of available nutrients
- **Microbial activity**: Introduces beneficial soil organisms

### Household Benefits
- **Convenience**: No daily compost pile management
- **All-weather**: Works indoors during winter months
- **No odors**: Properly managed bokashi has a sweet, pickled smell
- **Space efficient**: Compact system perfect for urban gardens

## Getting Started with Bokashi

### What You'll Need
- **Bokashi bucket**: Airtight container with drainage spigot
- **EM bran**: Effective microorganisms for fermentation
- **Kitchen scraps**: Any organic waste from your kitchen
- **Patience**: 2-3 weeks for fermentation process

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Layer scraps**: Add 2-3 inches of kitchen waste to bucket
2. **Sprinkle EM**: Cover with thin layer of bokashi bran
3. **Press down**: Remove air pockets and add weight
4. **Repeat**: Continue layering until bucket is full
5. **Ferment**: Seal and wait 2-3 weeks
6. **Bury**: Dig fermented waste into garden soil

## Resources & Supplies

### Team Supplies
- **Community buckets**: Available for checkout
- **EM bran**: Bulk purchasing for team members
- **Educational materials**: Guides, troubleshooting sheets
- **Tools**: Weights, scoops, pH strips for monitoring

### Learning Resources
- **Bokashi library**: Books and guides on fermentation composting
- **Online community**: Connection to regional bokashi groups
- **Expert contacts**: Local specialists and suppliers
- **Scientific studies**: Research on bokashi effectiveness

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Fermentation Problems
- **Bad smell**: Usually too wet or not enough EM
- **White mold**: Good sign! Shows proper fermentation
- **Blue/black mold**: Problem - compost traditionally instead
- **Liquid accumulation**: Normal - use as plant fertilizer

### Burial Issues
- **Slow decomposition**: Need more moisture or better soil contact
- **Pest attraction**: Bury deeper (at least 8 inches)
- **pH concerns**: Test soil and adjust if needed
- **Winter burial**: Use greenhouse or indoor plant pots

## Safety & Best Practices

### Health & Hygiene
- **Clean hands**: Wash thoroughly after handling fermented waste
- **Tool cleaning**: Sanitize buckets and tools regularly
- **Proper burial**: Follow depth guidelines to prevent issues
- **Pet safety**: Keep pets away from fresh bokashi burial sites

### Environmental Considerations
- **Site rotation**: Don't overload any single burial area
- **Soil testing**: Monitor pH and nutrient levels
- **Water management**: Ensure proper drainage in burial areas
- **Plant compatibility**: Some plants prefer fresh vs. aged bokashi
